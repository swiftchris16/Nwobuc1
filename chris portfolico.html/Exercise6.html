<p class = bold> What It Escargot? </p>

<p class = P>Escargot, means "edible snail", seems to date from 1892 and is a cooked land snail. Not all species of <br> land snail are edible, and many are too small to make it worthwhile to prepare and cook them. Even <br> among the edible species, the palatability of the flesh varies from species to species. In France, the <br> species "Helix pomatia" is most often eaten.</p>

<p class = bold>How Is It Prepared?</p>

<p class = P>In French cuisine, the snails are typically purged, killed, removed from their shells, and cooked (usually <br> with garlic butter, chicken soup or wine), and then placed back into the shells with the butter and <br> sauce for serving. Additional ingredients may be added, such as garlic, thyme, parsley and pine nuts.<br> Special snail tongs (for holding the shell) and snail forks (for extracting the meat) are also normally <br> provided, and they are served on indented metal trays with places for six or 12 snails.</p>
